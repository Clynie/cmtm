##This is a matlab to python conversion of Peter Huybers Multi-taper coherence method with bias correction

https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22551-multi-taper-coherence-method-with-bias-correction/content/cmtm.m

### Multi-taper coherence analysis cmtm.m, requires the signal toolbox for Matlab and following routines: cohconf.m to calculate confidence levels; cohbias.m to correct for the bias inherent to coherence estimates; and cohbias.mat which is used with cohbias.m. These files allow for the estimation of coherence and phase using the mult-taper method with adaptive weighting. Note that coherence is returned, not coherence-squared, as with the Matlab cohere.m function. Confidence intervals are estimated for both coherence and phase along with an option to plot the results.
